## A quick introduction to RabbitMQ

Before we dive into the practical implementation, it's crucial to establish a foundational understanding of RabbitMQ, including the intricacies of queues and exchanges.

RabbitMQ serves as open-source message broker software, providing a messaging system for the exchange of messages between distinct applications and services. It stands as a robust and scalable messaging platform widely embraced in distributed systems.

RabbitMQ operates by implementing the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), a standardized messaging protocol for message-oriented middleware. This software supports various messaging patterns, including publish/subscribe, request/response, and work queues. It provides message queues, exchanges, and bindings, enabling different applications and services to communicate in a distributed environment.

RabbitMQ enjoys compatibility with a wide spectrum of programming languages and platforms, encompassing Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, and more. Furthermore, it supports various messaging protocols, including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and HTTP.

### Reasons to Leverage RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ emerges as a dependable and scalable messaging platform designed for distributed systems. Here are key features that make RabbitMQ a compelling choice:

1. **High Availability**: RabbitMQ supports clustering, fostering high availability and fault tolerance by connecting multiple nodes.

1. **Routing**: RabbitMQ facilitates diverse routing algorithms and message exchange types, ensuring messages reach their intended destinations accurately.

1. **Message Durability**: By persisting messages to disk, RabbitMQ ensures message durability, preventing message loss even in the event of system failures.

1. **Security**: RabbitMQ offers robust security measures, including SSL/TLS encryption, access control, and user authentication.

### RabbitMQ Queues

A RabbitMQ message queue functions as a buffer, temporarily storing messages until they are ready for processing by the consuming application or service. Each message within a queue possesses a unique identifier and remains in memory or on disk until it is either consumed by a consumer or reaches its predefined time-to-live (TTL). RabbitMQ queues can be configured to support various message delivery types, such as round-robin, priority-based, or topic-based routing.

At a high level, consider a message queue as a sizable buffer capable of retaining all your messages, awaiting consumption by the intended consumers.

Below is a diagram showing at a high level how a message queue works. You have one or more producers (the client) generating messages and publishing them to a queue. 
One or more consumers (the worker) can then consume the messages in the queue.

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Message Queue
    participant Worker

    Client->>Message Queue: Send Message
    Message Queue->>Worker: Enqueue Message
    Worker->>Message Queue: Dequeue Message
    Message Queue->>Worker: Return Message
    Worker->>Client: Process Message
```

### RabbitMQ Exchanges

With the basics of queues understood, let's delve further into exchanges. An exchange, a core component of a message broker, receives messages from producers and directs them to message queues based on specific routing rules. Exchanges are responsible for receiving messages and routing them to one or more queues, determined by message type and routing keys.

How does this work in practice? When a producer dispatches a message to RabbitMQ, it first reaches an exchange, which subsequently routes the message to one or more message queues based on message type and routing key. MassTransit, by default, employs the Fanout routing algorithm, which is the focus of this tutorial. However, for reference, a list of different exchange types supported by RabbitMQ concerning message routing is provided:

1. **Direct Exchange** - Direct exchanges route messages to a queue based on the exact match between the routing key and the binding key.
1. **Fanout Exchange** - Fanout exchanges route messages to all the queues that are bound to them, regardless of the routing key. (this is the one we will be working with in this tutorial)
1. **Topic Exchange** - Topic exchanges route messages based on pattern matching between the routing key and the binding key. The routing key can contain wildcards, allowing for more flexible routing.
1. **Headers Exchange** - Headers exchanges route messages based on the headers of the message, which can be any key-value pair.

The illustration below provides an overview of how the Fanout Exchange operates in RabbitMQ.

``` mermaid
graph TD
subgraph Producer
    A[Producer] -->|Message| B(Fanout Exchange)
end
subgraph Fanout Exchange
    B -->|Message| C(Queue 1)
    B -->|Message| D(Queue 2)
    B -->|Message| E(Queue 3)
end
subgraph Queue 3
    E -->|Message| H(Consumer 3)
end
subgraph Queue 2
    D -->|Message| G(Consumer 2)
end
subgraph Queue 1
    C -->|Message| F(Consumer 1)
end
```

## Implementation of MassTransit in .NET Core

Now, let's proceed to the part you've eagerly anticipated. If you've read through the introductions, my compliments. I acknowledge it was a substantial amount of information, but it is essential to possess this knowledge to construct a distributed application and grasp the underlying mechanisms.

### Deploy RabbitMQ using Docker

Our initial task is to ensure a running instance of RabbitMQ. I will employ Docker to launch and manage RabbitMQ. You can use PowerShell or your terminal to execute the following command, compatible with both Windows and Linux environments:

``` bash
docker run -d --hostname twc-rabbitmq-server --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.13-rc-management
```

What transpires when you execute this command?

- The most recent available management image of RabbitMQ from Docker is retrieved.
- The hostname is configured as "twc-rabbitmq-server," which you can customize as desired.
- The container is named "rabbitmq."
- Ports 5672 and 15672 are exposed for the container, mapping to the same ports internally. Port 5672 is the designated port for sending and publishing messages, while port 15672 serves as the administration panel accessible via a web browser.
- 
With Docker's assistance, RabbitMQ is up and running. To explore the RabbitMQ administration panel, open your web browser and navigate to "localhost:15672." You can log in using the default credentials: "guest/guest." We will delve into the utilization of this web panel later in this article.
You may want to quickly check the logs to ensure no errors occurred. You can do so by executing the following command:

``` bash
docker logs rabbitmq
```
