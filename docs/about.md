# About

I am an experienced senior software engineer and mentor with over two decades of professional expertise. Presently, I am employed at [JJ Richards & Sons](https://www.jjrichards.com.au/jjs-waste-recycling), where my focus lies in the development of enterprise applications utilizing technologies such as .NET, Blazor, and Azure. I thrive on challenging projects and possess the proficiency to transform initial proposals into meticulously crafted, well-defined, coded, and thoroughly tested solutions.
